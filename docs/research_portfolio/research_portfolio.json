Mono Lake has suffered ecologically from diversions of water toward Los Angeles. As the lake levels have dropped, the lake has experienced negative ecological consequences. As the lake level decreases to 6,377ft above sea level (yellow line), land bridges emerge between the mainland and islands allowing predators to access major bird nesting sites. If lake levels decreased below 6,360ft (dark red line), lake salinity would reach 120 g/L decreasing brine shrimp populations and the California gull populations that depend on brine shrimp. At 6,350ft (black line) the impact of salinity would be above 150 g/L. In 1979 (highlighted in dark blue), Public Trust Suit brought before the Mono County Superior Court by the National Audubon Society, Mono Lake Committee, and others. This process was the cornerstone of the legal efforts to protect Mono Lake from diversion by the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP). Eventually the case was carried up to the California Supreme Court. In 1983 (highlighted in purple), the California Supreme Court ruled that water diversions by the LA DWP violated the Public Trust Doctrine - stating that certain resources are too valuable to be privately owned and must remain available for public use - invalidating LA’s prior water allocation decisions of the streams feeding the lake.In 1994 (highlight in red), the State Water Resouces Control Board issued Decision 1631, a landmark decision amending DWP’s water diversion licenses in the Mono Basin to proctect fisheries and ensure the lake’s public trust values were protected (Data: Mono Basin Clearinghouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nThis report provides an exploratory overview of differences in snowshoe hare weights between male and female sexes at three different monitoring sites within the Bonanza Creek U.S. Long Term Ecological Research Network in Interior Alaska from 1999 - 2012 (Kielland et al. 2017). Specifically, weight is compared between sex, and the relationship between weight and hind foot length are explored.\nData and analyses\nSnowshoe hare measurements were collected and made available by Dr. Knut Kielland and colleagues at the Bonanza Creek LTER network site in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in Interior Alaska. The data contains 3197 observations of snowshoe hares on a variety of parameters, collected between 1999 and 2012. Following an exploratory data visualization, weights between male and female snowshoe hares are examined by two-sample t-tests using a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05 throughout. Differences between groups are described by Cohen’s d effect size. The relationship between weight and hind foot length is explored using a simple linear regression. All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1056.\nExploratory Findings\nAnnual juvenile hare trap counts\nFrom Figure 1 it appears that the observations of juvenile snowshoe hare trap counts have declined between 1999 and 2012. The maximum juvenile snowshoe hare trap count was 167 in 1999 and the minimum juvenile hare trap counts are 0 in 2002 and 2009. The mean and median counts across the study period are 27 and 16 (rounded from 15.5), respectively. Without a deeper understanding of the frequency of the trap counts it appears that juvenile snowshoe hare counts have decreased fairly substantially between 1999 and 2012. It appears that there was some inconsistency across the number of days per year where researchers counted juvenile hares. To overcome this inconsistency, I would suggest determining a set length of days to make observations (i.e. 15 days per year) during the same period of time in order to get more consistent sampling.\n\n\nhide\n\n# Read in the data\nbonanza_hares <- read.csv(file ='data/bonanza_hares.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# i.

We can see that juvenile hares tended to be counted at the highest rate at the Bonanza Riparian monitoring site. There are a few instances where hare sex was undetermined, but weight was specified. In order to avoid impacting the male and female data, undetermined values are left as “NA”.\n\n\nhide\n\n# ii.

On average, juvenile male hares weighed the most (945.8588957 \\(\\pm\\) 333.2150693 grams, n = 163; mean \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation), compared to female hares (855.3908629 \\(\\pm\\) 292.2525894 grams, n = 197; mean \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation)(Table 1). While the absolute difference in means is 90.47 grams (a 10.05% difference), the difference in means is significant (Welch’s two-sample t-test: t(325.02) = 2.71, p = 0.007093279), and the effect size is large (Cohen’s d = 0.29).\nRelationship between juvenile weight and hind foot length\nAs a starting point, the relationship between weight and hind foot length was explored (ignoring sex and monitoring site). A further analysis should be conducted to compare the relationship between weight and hind foot length between male and female hares, and should include monitoring site as an additional variable.\n\n\nhide\n\n# iv.

A simple linear regression was used to explore the relationship between snowshoe hare weight (gm) and hind foot length (mm) across the snowshoe hares including all three monitoring sites, and includes both male and female snowshoe hares. The simple linear regression revealed that hind foot length moderately predicts hare weight (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3 with an average slope of \\(\\beta\\) = 9.52g mm-1 (i.e. for each one millimeter increase in hind foot length we expect an average increase of hare weight of 9.52 g). Hind foot length and weight have a medium positive correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.55, p < 0.001). We can see from the results that the residuals are heteroscedastic.\n\n\nhide\n\nggplot(data = bonanza_hares_juvenile, aes(x = hindft, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = full_sex, pch = full_sex), size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"goldenrod2\", \"cyan4\", \"green4\"),\n                     name = \"Hare Sex\") +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(16,17,18),\n                     name= \"Hare Sex\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"gray30\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"\\nHind foot length (mm)\",\n       y = \"Weight (gm)\\n\") +\n  theme(legend.position = c(.095, 0.75))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Relationship between weight (gm) and hind foot length (mm) for snowshoe hares (includes all monitoring sites).

We will use binary logistic regression to test feasibility of using variables plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and number of green leaves to classify whether a palmetto is Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia.\nExploratory Data Visualization\nFrom our exploratory analysis of the variables, we can see that the number of green leaves seems to have the greatest impact on determining the difference between the species from the variables we have analyzed. Height, width and length do not produce noticeable differences between species.\n\nFIGURE 3: Of the variables of interest in this analysis the count of green leaves appears to be a decent determinant of distinguishing palmetto species Sabal etonia (red) and Serenoa repens (blue) from each other (Data: Abrahamson, 2019).Binary Logistic Regression Analysis\nBased on these plots the number of green leaves are more likely to help classify species correctly, but to be sure we will perform a binary logistic regression to determine the probability of a plant being either Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia based on these predictor variables.\nModel Selection\nWe are interested in performing a binary logistic regression to determine the probability of a plant being either Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia based on several predictor variables. This will help me compare the two models and determine which one might better predict a plant to be Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia.\nModel 1: Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves as predictor variables\nModel 2: Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width, and green leaves.\nUsing AIC to compare the two models, it appears that Model 1 is a superior model. Model 2 receives a AIC_c value of 792.91 when compared to Model 1. However, we conducted a ten-fold cross validation, repeated 20 times, Model 1 still appears to be a better model at predicting plant species. Model 1 has an accuracy of 0.916 and Model 2 has an accuracy of 0.898.\nCitation\nData source: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019.
