We will use binary logistic regression to test feasibility of using variables plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and number of green leaves to classify whether a palmetto is Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia.\nExploratory Data Visualization\nFrom our exploratory analysis of the variables, we can see that the number of green leaves seems to have the greatest impact on determining the difference between the species from the variables we have analyzed. Height, width and length do not produce noticeable differences between species.\n\nFIGURE 3: Of the variables of interest in this analysis the count of green leaves appears to be a decent determinant of distinguishing palmetto species Sabal etonia (red) and Serenoa repens (blue) from each other (Data: Abrahamson, 2019).Binary Logistic Regression Analysis\nBased on these plots the number of green leaves are more likely to help classify species correctly, but to be sure we will perform a binary logistic regression to determine the probability of a plant being either Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia based on these predictor variables.\nModel Selection\nWe are interested in performing a binary logistic regression to determine the probability of a plant being either Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia based on several predictor variables. This will help me compare the two models and determine which one might better predict a plant to be Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia.\nModel 1: Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width and green leaves as predictor variables\nModel 2: Log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width, and green leaves.\nUsing AIC to compare the two models, it appears that Model 1 is a superior model. Model 2 receives a AIC_c value of 792.91 when compared to Model 1. However, we conducted a ten-fold cross validation, repeated 20 times, Model 1 still appears to be a better model at predicting plant species. Model 1 has an accuracy of 0.916 and Model 2 has an accuracy of 0.898.\nCitation\nData source: Abrahamson, W.G. 2019.

We meet our client, Blue Forest Conservation in Bullard’s Bar Reservoir and toured a number of sites in the Yuba Watershed to discuss various project sites, wildfire impacts, restoration goals and the resevoir itself!\nBullards Bar ReservoirAfter discussing sedimentation and woody debris impacts to reservoir operations, we toured the Pendola Fire burn area where active restoration was taking place to reduce erosion and sediment into the reservoir.\nPendola Fire siteOn our second day, we meet with the general manager at Sierra Pacific Industries, where we toured their lumber mill and cogeneration facility. We learned about operations, discussed the impacts of wildfire risk to operations and toured the facility.\nSierra Pacific Industries tour\n\n\n",

Typically, folks prefer to start in Yosemite Valley and head south, but permits were pretty competitive so we opted to start just south of Mount Whitney and head north. The Sierra got some unusual late snow at the end of May, which set us up for a more challenging hike. It complicated our itinerary a bit, but was an incredible experience that I wouldn’t trade for anything.\nStunning Views\n\n\n",
